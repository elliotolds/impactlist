Bill Gates and Melinda Gates were married between January 1, 1994, and August 2, 2021, so Melinda gets half credit for donations made by the couple during that time.

  # Note on other philanthropic activities (from GPT o3 on May 6th 2025):
  Melinda French Gates announced in May 2024 that she would direct $1 billion towards advancing women's power and influence globally.
  The $200 million and $240 million donations listed above are significant initial distributions from this commitment.
  She also announced a $250 million grant competition, "Action for Women's Health," as part of this $1 billion, run via Lever for Change,
  which will award grants to organizations working on women's health. Specific recipients and dates for all these grants are not yet fully detailed.
  Additionally, upon her departure from the Gates Foundation in June 2024, she would receive $12.5 billion for her own philanthropic work,
  which will fund these and future initiatives focusing on women and families.
