GPT o3 estimates $1 for 500 chicken years. Assume a chicken year is a 100k times less valuable than a human year (huge assumption -- this should be a parameter in the model). so $1 for 0.005 human years. 
Or $1000 per 5 human years, or $16,000 per life 

OpenAIDeepResearch: ~$450 per “human-QALY-equivalent”. 
  Assuming moral weight conversions of animal welfare to human-equivalent QALYs. 
  Effective farm animal charities can spare on the order of 1–13 farmed animal lives from suffering per $1 donated. (No standard QALY metric; this is an approximate conversion.)
