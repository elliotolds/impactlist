OpenAIDeepResearch: "One estimate for anti-human-trafficking (Freedom Fund) was ~$657 per person freed from modern slavery. If one values “a life free from slavery” similarly to a life saved (which is debatable), this might equate to a few hundred dollars per life-year of freedom – quite cost-effective in terms of improving lives. Other human rights efforts (e.g. legal justice, advocacy) lack clear cost-per-QALY data; they generally focus on dignity and rights rather than health."

Me: the above seems like an outlier.. give them
