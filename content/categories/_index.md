# General notes from research

GiveWell’s current bar for funding is ≈ $100 / DALY (≈ $7 500 / life) – interventions cheaper than that generally get funded.

Rich-country health systems (NICE, ICER) pay up to $50-100 k / QALY; anything cheaper is “excellent” by their standards.


OpenPhil's bar is $50 per DALY (2023): https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-planned-allocation-to-givewells-recommendations-for-the-next-few-years/
