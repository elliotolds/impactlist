## Most Critical Instructions
- Never try to run the web server. I'm already running it. If you want to test your changes just ask me of it works.
- Never try to run any git commands unless I explicitly ask you to. I'll handle all git stuff.
- Please only use pure JavaScript, plus React, plus Tailwind, plus Vite. Don't introduce any other frameworks or languages or complexity unless you specifically ask. We want to keep the tech stack simple.
- Please use best practices for all of these frameworks and languages. For instance when doing CSS stuff, do it the way that corresponds to best practices for Tailwind. Same for React, Vite, and JavaScript.
- Pay a lot of attention to code quality, maintainability, and for instance not duplicating code when a utility function would be better, or having lots of magic numbers around.
