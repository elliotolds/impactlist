# Contributing Research

See /content/README.md for info on the structure of the content data files.

To contribute research to the default cost per life values of the donation categories, you can find the category markdown files in /content/categories.
You can add detailed justifications for other researchers under the "Internal Notes" heading. The content in all other headings will be displayed
on the website.

Open a github pull request with your proposed changes to this file (changes to the cost per life value, and your justification for this).
If it looks reasonable it will be merged. Otherwise I'll discuss in the pull request comments.

To contribute research for the effectiveness of a specific donation recipient, see the files in /content/recipients. The process is similar to
the one described above.

If you don't want to go through the above process, and you have some information that you think would be useful to me for improving the effectiveness data,
feel free to send me an email at elliotolds at \[Gmail's email service\].
